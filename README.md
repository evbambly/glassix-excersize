## About the Project

This was my first React.js app, 
as I had learned React while building it.
I have implemented complex data structures such as-
callbacks, default props, environment variables, gitIgnore, as well as importing a UI framework (UI Material).

The three buttons in the app enable (in order): 
To see the approximate location of the IP from street view.
To see the approximate location of the IP from a sattelite view.
To find McDonald's in the city the IP appears to be from.

*Note* The accuracy of location prediction from IP is not high.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
